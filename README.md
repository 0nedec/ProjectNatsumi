# Project Natsumi
## by @shogunlab

This repo is a follow-along to the awesome work by @shogunlab found: [here](https://shogunlab.gitbook.io/building-c2-implants-in-cpp-a-primer).

My interest in this project was due to a renascent love of C++, as well wanting to dip my toes into basic maldev.

This is not my code or original work, but if I end up adding anything I'll make sure my additions are clearly 
noted.

Once fully implemented the goal of this is to have the following functionality:
- C2 Server (aka listening post) written in python with a MongoDB backend.
- Basic Implant (aka agent) written in C++
- Operator CLI

Happy Hacking!
